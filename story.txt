It was a pretty cloudy day in Berlin
which made frank want to stop by the Baeckerei
So he could complain about the Apfelkuchen.
They were very bland and the Gebaeck weren't much better
Giving the Baeckerei one last chance, Frank decided to try some of the brot.
That is when he heard his favorite band, Rammstein.
On his way to go check out the band he saw a pair of Lederhose
So he picked them up off the ground and changed his pants in the middle of the Hauptstrasse.
He was then found be some Raesfeld, who questioned his actions...
Frank then remembered he was a wanted criminal and needed to get out of the area, so he looked around for the nearest Porsche or BMW to make his getaway.
